# infocus
Small app that checks focus status under macOS 12

runs from the command line. If the user has a Focus mode set, exits with code 1, otherwise exits with code 0

In theory this should run under macOS 10.15/11 (or earlier) as well as soon as I can get around the app sandbox rules that come with adding the communications notifications entitlements required for macOS 12
